# intro-to-data-linking

This repo hosts tutorial notebooks and associated files for my talk/workshop, *An Introduction to Data Linking*.

## Slides
You can find the accompanying slide deck here: [https://slides.com/rachhouse/intro-to-data-linking](https://slides.com/rachhouse/intro-to-data-linking).


## How to Access the Tutorial Notebooks
The tutorial notebooks are meant to be run in [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/). There are two ways to open these notebooks in your own Colab session, via the Colab badge link in the notebook on GitHub or directly from Colab.

1. You can open the notebook from GitHub by clicking on the Colab badge at the top of the notebook, as shown below. However, note that sometimes GitHub doesn't render the notebooks in the browser correctly. If you experience an error rendering the notebook and are unable to use the Colab badge, just open the notebook directly from Colab (see option 2).

2. To open the tutorial notebooks directly from Colab, navigate to the **GitHub** tab in the Colab opening dialog. Paste this repo's URL (`https://github.com/rachhouse/intro-to-data-linking`) on the input line and then click the magnifying glass to load the available notebooks. Make sure you are on branch **main**. From there, simply click on the notebook you'd like to open, and Colab will load it.
